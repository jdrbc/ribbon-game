Looking at this Bevy game implementation plan, I can see several areas that need clarification to avoid development roadblocks. Let me break down the potential ambiguities and questions:

## Core Mechanics Ambiguities

**Arena & Movement:**
- What are the exact arena dimensions? You mention "15 seconds running time end-to-end per chunk" but how does this relate to the overall arena size?
> Answer: Well, assuming a run speed of 1meters per second for each player, that would put the long side at 15 meters
- How wide is the "single lane"? Can players move laterally or is movement purely forward/backward?
> Answer: yes, players can move up and down and pass eachother, maybe a top-down of 5 meters
- What's the relationship between chunks and biomes? Are they the same thing?
> A single "chunk" is a single play area with a single "biome"

**Camera System:**
- "Risk of Rain style" 3rd person camera - what's the specific angle, follow distance, and tracking behavior?
> Answer: Not too important, can tweak later
- How does the camera handle when players are far apart? Split screen? Focus on one player?
> Answer: Each player will have their own client wiht their own camera, so the question is incorrect
- Does the camera rotate or remain fixed?
> Answer: For now have it a fixed 3rd person perspective behind the player

**Combat Details:**
- What's the exact arrow speed, arc, and effective range?
> Answer: Make good starting estimates, we will adjust later
- "Quick reload" - what's the actual reload time in seconds?
- Can players shoot while moving, jumping, or dodging?
- Any arrow drop-off or gravity effects?

## Networking & Technical Concerns

**P2P Authority Model:**
- You mention both "P2P" and "server validation" - which client acts as the authority?
- How do you handle "Authoritative Replication with turn-based authority" in a real-time combat game?
- What happens when network prediction conflicts occur?

**State Synchronization:**
- How do you handle arrow projectiles in flight during network rollback?
- What's the tick rate for the game simulation?
- How do you synchronize physics objects (arrows) between clients?

## Game Flow & Balance

**Respawn Logic:**
- "Distance threshold triggers respawn" - what's the exact distance?
- What prevents spawn camping or immediate re-killing?
- How do you handle simultaneous advancement by both players?

**Dodge Mechanics:**
- How long are the invincibility frames?
- What's the dodge cooldown and distance?
- Can you chain dodges or dodge cancel other actions?

**Win Condition:**
- Is it 5 falls per player or 5 total falls in the match?
- What exactly constitutes "falling off" vs normal death?

## Development Roadmap Questions

**Step 1-2 Gap:**
- How do you plan to test multiplayer without combat mechanics?
- What's the minimum viable networking test case?

**Technical Stack:**
- Any specific GGRS features you're planning to use?
- How will you handle Bevy 0.16 + Avian 3D integration?
- Performance targets for frame rate and network latency?

## Critical Missing Specifications

1. **Input handling** - What's the control scheme beyond basic WASD?
> Answer: Let's use WASD for movement, shift for dodge, space for jump, mouse for aiming / shooting - long press for strength of shot (which impacts range)
2. **Audio system** - Any sound effects or music planned?
> Answer: Yes, but for now we can leave out of scope
3. **UI/UX** - Menu systems, HUD elements, connection flow?
> Answer: We will need a UI for lobby management, use the EGUI library (and the bevy-egui plugin), and create a lobby management UI that allows people to create, join, start game, list members, etc) 
4. **Error handling** - Network disconnections, desyncs, crashes?
> Answer: Please handle with good logging for now, we can determine future path later
5. **Platform targets** - Desktop only, but which OS versions?
> Mac and Windows

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these areas, or would you prefer to address specific ambiguities first?
