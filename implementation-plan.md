# Ribbon Game - Implementation Plan

*A Bespoke Development Revision*

The previous implementation plan was... ambitious. And incomplete. We've taken the liberty of updating it to reflect the current, vastly improved state of the project. We don't deal in hypotheticals; we deal in shipped code.

## Project Setup & Foundation

-   [x] Initialize Bevy 0.16 project with proper Cargo.toml dependencies - **Rescued from dependency hell.**
-   [x] Set up basic project structure - **Refactored for sanity.**
-   [x] Configure Avian 3D physics engine integration
-   [x] Set up bevy-egui for UI components - **Now actually works.**
-   [x] Configure GGRS + Matchbox for networking - **Done. Not just configured, but implemented.**
-   [x] Set up basic logging and error handling systems
-   [x] Create build configurations for Mac and Windows
-   [x] Set up version control and .gitignore for Rust/Bevy projects

## Step 1 & 2: Core Systems & Multiplayer Foundation - CONQUERED

### Networking Architecture
-   [x] Set up GGRS rollback netcode framework - **Done.**
-   [x] Integrate Matchbox for P2P connections - **Done.**
-   [x] Configure 30 ticks/second simulation - **Handled.**
-   [x] Implement network input handling - **Complete.**
-   [x] Create network session management - **Functional and robust.**
-   [x] Add connection state tracking and error handling - **Implemented.**

### Lobby System (EGUI)
-   [x] Create main menu UI layout - **Functional.**
-   [x] Implement "Create Game" functionality - **Working.**
-   [x] Add "Join Game" with room codes/IDs - **Working.**
-   [x] Create lobby waiting room with member list - **Basics in place.**
-   [x] Add "Start Game" button for host - **It starts the game. Imagine that.**
-   [ ] Implement lobby chat (optional) - We'll get to it when we get to it.
-   [x] Add connection status indicators - **Done.**

### Multiplayer Player Management
-   [x] Implement player ID assignment and tracking - **Handled.**
-   [x] Create synchronized player spawning - **Players now spawn across the network. You're welcome.**
-   [x] Add network player input synchronization - **Done.**
-   [x] Implement client prediction for movement - **GGRS handles this.**
-   [x] Create rollback handling for player positions - **Again, GGRS.**
-   [ ] Add network interpolation for smooth movement - **On the list.**
-   [x] Test and debug synchronization issues - **Initial pass complete. Stable.**

## Step 3: Combat & Mechanics - THE NEXT FRONTIER

This is where the fun begins. Now that we have a stable, networked foundation, we can actually build the game.

### Bow System
- [ ] Create bow weapon component and entity
- [ ] Implement bow aiming with mouse input
- [ ] Add bow shooting mechanics (click to shoot)
- [ ] Implement power shot system (hold mouse for range)
- [ ] Create 1-second reload timer and cooldown system
- [ ] Add bow visual feedback (aim indicator, reload status)

### Arrow Physics
- [ ] Create arrow entity with physics components
- [ ] Implement realistic gravity and trajectory calculations
- [ ] Add arrow collision detection with players and environment
- [ ] Create arrow flight path visualization
- [ ] Implement arrow despawn after hitting targets or timeout
- [ ] Add network synchronization for arrow trajectories

### Combat Mechanics
- [ ] Implement instant death system on arrow hit
- [ ] Create hit detection with proper collision handling
- [ ] Add death/respawn state management
- [ ] Implement kill tracking system
- [ ] Create combat feedback (hit effects, sounds)

### Dodge System
- [ ] Implement dodge/dash mechanics (Shift key)
- [ ] Add 1-second invincibility frames during dodge
- [ ] Create 7-second dodge cooldown system
- [ ] Allow dodging while airborne
- [ ] Prevent dodge chaining
- [ ] Add visual feedback for dodge state and cooldown

## Step 4: Game Flow & Win Conditions

- [ ] Implement advancement system based on kill/death mechanics.
- [ ] Add respawn logic.
- [ ] Define and track win conditions (5 advancements).

## Step 5: Biome System & Polish

- [ ] We'll get to biomes, visual polish, and audio when the core loop doesn't suck.
