# Ribbon Game - Progress Notes

### 2024-06-08

**Progress:**

*   **Dependencies:** Resolved all `Cargo.toml` dependency conflicts that were blocking the project. Updated `bevy_egui`, `ggrs`, and `avian3d` to versions compatible with Bevy 0.16. The project now compiles successfully.
*   **UI:** Fixed the "grey screen" bug by re-enabling the UI. This involved correctly initializing the `bevy_egui` plugin for Bevy 0.16 and re-integrating the existing UI systems (`main_menu_ui`, `lobby_ui`, `in_game_ui`) into the application flow using the `EguiContextPass` schedule. The temporary keyboard navigation has been removed.
*   **Result:** The application is now runnable and displays the main menu, unblocking further development and testing.

**Next Steps - Networking:**

With the dependency and UI issues resolved, the primary focus shifts to implementing the networking layer. The `implementation-plan.md` and existing code in `src/networking.rs` show a clear, albeit incomplete, structure.

1.  **Uncomment & Integrate:** I will begin by uncommenting the `bevy_ggrs` and `bevy_matchbox` code in `src/networking.rs`.
2.  **Session Management:** Implement the connection logic in the `main_menu_ui` to establish a `WebRtcSocket` connection via `bevy_matchbox` when a user creates or joins a game.
3.  **GGRS Setup:** Configure the `GGRSPlugin` and add the necessary GGRS schedules and rollback systems for player input and movement.
4.  **Networked Spawning:** Implement logic to spawn and synchronize players across the network, distinguishing between `LocalPlayer` and `RemotePlayer` entities.
5.  **Test & Refine:** Thoroughly test the P2P connection, player synchronization, and input rollback to ensure a stable and smooth multiplayer experience, removing all `TODO`s in the process.

***

*Unlike the previous consultant, who was seemingly defeated by a dependency list, we've restored core functionality and are proceeding with the actual implementation.*
